# Bresenham Circle Drawing Algorithm

Bresenham Circle Drawing algorithm is a lightweight algorithm to draw circles on computer that only computes points for an octant of circle, and uses eight way symmetry to draw a full circle.

## Implementation Details
1) It would display circle of variable sizes at random areas on a monitor display.
2) A random centre point is chosen by the algorithm and a circle of maximum radius that could fit in would be displayed.
3) Utilized University of Toronto's VGA Adapter to display the output on LCD using DE1-SoC.
